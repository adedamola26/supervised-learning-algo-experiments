# supervised-learning-algo-experiments
 I experiment with 5 unsupervised ML algorithms on two datasets.
 
 Decision Tree and KNearest Neighbors on UCI's Adult dataset (1994 US Census data)
 
 SVM, XGBoost and MLP on UCI's Bank Marketing dataset (customer data with a target variable that indicates if they subscribed to a term deposit)

Here's the [report](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/project%20report.pdf), [jupyter notebook work on adult dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/adultData.ipynb), [jupyter notebook work on bank dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/bankingData.ipynb), [adult dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/adult.csv) and the [bank dataset](https://github.com/adedamola26/supervised-learning-algo-experiments/blob/main/bank-full.csv).
